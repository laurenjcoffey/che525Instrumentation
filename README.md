## Explanation of Equipment Built
We first focused on wiring all the instruments up, including the level transmitter, pressure transmitter, flow meter, and RTD.

I was first part of the group tasked with preparing the ethernet cable for the Coriolis flow meter. The purpose of this cable is to connect the flow meter to our data historian. Next, I aided in setting up the CHARMS, which connect to the CHARM I/O Card, which communicates to the controllers. This step is crucial in order to set up the flow meter with our control system. After this, I further aided in wiring for the Coriolis flow meter by attaching the positive terminal, negative terminal, and ground.

Information for the installed instrument is detailed in the table below:

Table 1. Installed Instruments
